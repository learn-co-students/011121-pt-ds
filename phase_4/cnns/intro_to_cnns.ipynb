Multilayer perceptrons usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"fully-connectedness\" of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization include adding some form of magnitude measurement of weights to the loss function. However, CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns.\"\n",

    "The two distinctive types of layer inside of a typical CNN (and there may be several of each in a single network) are **convolutional** and **pooling** layers. Let's look at each in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional nets employ [convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), which are a certain kind of transformation. In the context of neural networks processing images, this can be thought of as sliding a filter (of weights) over the image matrix to produce a new matrix of values. (I'll detail the calculation below.) The relative smallness of the filter means both that there will be relatively few parameters to learn and that the values representing certain areas of the image will be affected only by the values of *nearby areas*. This helps the network in **feature detection**. Let's check out some visualizations [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-intuitive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-260c2de0a050/).\n",

    "*image thanks to [Daphne Cornelisse](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-intuitive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-260c2de0a050/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Utkarsh Sinha shows us some examples of different kinds of filters [here](http://aishack.in/tutorials/convolutions/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 important hyperparameters to consider when designing your convolutional layers:\n",
    "1. Filter Dimensions\n",
    "2. Stride\n",
    "3. Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Filter Dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are simply the shape of your filter.  (2,2) would be a 2 by 2 filter covering 4 total pixels.  (3,3) 3 by 3 and cover 9 pixels.  No matter the size, the filter will return a single value on each step.  The math is shown below.  Also, color images have 3 'channels' or layers, Red, Blue, and Green pixel values.  So, a 3x3 filter for a color image would actually have size 3x3x3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Stride\n",
    "\n",
    "Stride is how far the filter moves with each step.  A stride of 1 means the filter moves over by 1 pixel on each step, the animation above demonstrates a 3x3 filter with a stride of 1.  A filter with a stride of 2 would move 2 pixels on each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Padding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Padding is technically not a feature of the filter, but is preparation of the data before the filter is passed over it.  A convolutional layer can add a layer of zeros aorund the edge of the image to change the size of the output matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Valid padding** means no padding.  The layer will output a smaller matrix than the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Same padding** will output a matrix of the same size as the input matrix.  This is done by adding a layer of zeros all the way around the image of size `filter // 2` or filter size divided by 2, rounded down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Full padding** adds a layer of zeros of size `filter - 1`.  This will output a matrix larger than in input and each pixel will be in each position of the filter kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "![padding](../resources/padding.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Math:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a 3x3 image with no padding and a 2x2 filter and a stride of 1. Then the calculation goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "a & b & c \\\\\n",
    "d & e & g \\\\\n",
    "h & j & k\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} *\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "f_1 & f_2 \\\\\n",
    "f_3 & f_4\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "f_1a + f_2b + f_3d + f_4e & f_1b + f_2c + f_3e + f_4g \\\\\n",
    "f_1d + f_2e + f_3h + f_4j & f_1e + f_2g + f_3j + f_4k\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: Line up the filter with the image, multiply all the corresponding pairs and then add up those products. Repeat for all positions of the filter as allowed by [the stride and the padding](https://adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Part-2/). The relative position of the filter to the image will tell you which entry in the resultant matrix you're filling in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try an example of horizontal edge detection. One good filter for that might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "10 & 10 & 10 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "-10 & -10 & -10\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we apply this filter to (i.e. *convolve*) an image with a clear horizontal edge, such as this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "200 & 200 & 200 & 200 & 200 \\\\\n",
    "200 & 200 & 200 & 200 & 200 \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pooling\n",
    "What is pooling? The main goal in inserting a pooling layer is to reduce dimensionality, which helps to reduce both network computation and model overfitting. This is generally a matter of reducing a matrix or tensor of values to  some smaller size, and the most common way of doing this is by partitioning the large matrix into $n$ x $n$ blocks and then replacing each with the largest value in the block. Hence we speak of \"MaxPooling\".\n",

    "### Max Pooling in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "![max pooling example](../resources/maxpool.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of convolutional layers and pooling layers compress two dimensions of the image while deepening the last through the repeated application of *multiple filters* per layer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the multiple different filters, or kernels, on each layer produce their own output which is generally smaller (in the case of valid padding) in \"width\" and \"height\" and the layer stacks the output of each filter to make the 3rd dimension of the matrix, \"depth\" greater.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers further compress the \"height\" and \"width\" by pulling out the most relevant features of the image, those with the greatest activation value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Densely connected layers are generally added in the last few layers in image classification tasks.\n",
